# Title: Efficiency Analysis of Batch Processing in ERC-20 Token Transfers on Ethereum

## Abstract

This paper presents an empirical analysis of gas consumption in executing ERC-20 token transfers on the Ethereum blockchain. We compare the traditional method of individual transaction calls against an optimized batch processing approach using a custom batching contract. The study aims to quantify the efficiency gains, in terms of gas costs, achieved through batch processing over a significant number of transactions.

## Introduction

The scalability and efficiency of operations on blockchain networks are of paramount concern as these networks grow in usage and complexity. Specifically, the cost associated with executing transactions on the Ethereum network, measured in gas fees, has been a critical focus area for developers and users. This study focuses on ERC-20 token transfers, a common type of transaction on Ethereum, exploring how batch processing can optimize transaction costs without sacrificing the decentralization or security of the network.

## Background
